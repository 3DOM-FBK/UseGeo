# UseGeo - UAV-based multi-sensor dataset for geospatial research

[Benchmark data]

_________________________________________________________________________
### 1. Dataset Description
USEGEO is an <a href="http://www.isprs.org">ISPRS</a> Scientific Initiative which aims to deliver a new and unique dataset for the rigorous assessment of 3D reconstruction algorithms applied to datasets acquired with UAV platforms. 

We present a new large-scale real-world depth estimation set of data which include data acquired from UAV platforms. The provided data aim to support research in both monocular depth estimation and multi-view 3D reconstruction. 


#### Flight specifications

* Area Covered: 1100 x 650 meters
* Average flight height: 80m above ground
* GDS: approx. 2 cm
* Image overlap: 80% (forward) - 60% (side)
* LiDaR point cloud density 51 points/m2 (approx.)

#### Images
* Total number of images: 828
* Image resolution 7952 x 5304 pixel
